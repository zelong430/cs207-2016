    "### FUTURES\n",
    "\n",
    "A future, or promise, is something that represents a pending opearion and returns straight away. \n",
    "\n",
    "You have seen one idea of futures in the Lazy eval\" paer of this course where we created a class instance instead of executing a function. Thean calling `eval` evaluated the function. But we stopped there, not constructing a structure in which we figure where and when we should execute the `eval`, and how we should return the result to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "These issues become important when we are running many threads or are in a callback based system. We'll see how python handles this with threads for us, and later, how we would do this for co-routines and callbacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the `concurrent.futures` module here to do this. One creates a \"thread pool\" with multiple threads (or processes). One can then query their state of completion, or register callbacks to be called on successful completion or error.\n",

This leaves you with the choice of sending the data only to a child process, or using multiprocessing.reduction to somehow pickle the socket, or preforking (what apache does) in which the accept is run in the client (see http://foobarnbaz.com/2011/08/30/developing-scalable-services-with-python/) for an example.\n",
